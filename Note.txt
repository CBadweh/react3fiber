Run the program
r3f_PhysicSim $ npm run dev


Following The lesson
1.  Create a Cube
    Understand
        Canvas
            Lighting
            boxMesh
                Component + Props for the box position, size, and color

2.  Animation
    Understand
        useFrame(state, delta) hook allow us to run callback function on every frame
            state - contain the properties of current scene eg clock, camera
            delta - time in sec since the last frame
        useRef() // have access to mesh properties

3.  Testing: Pause/Resume the animation using <button> component and useState(). Not using Lava
    Understand
        custom React Component <button>
            button update UI on "Pause Animation" or "Start Animation"
        useState() - trigger by <button> to pause/resume animation in useFrame()
        
        timerRef = useRef(0)
            when we pause the simulation, we also need to pause time to prevent jerk in the animation
            we accomplish this by using timerRef. If simulation is not running, don't increase time
